This is a template you can use to make your own resource pack for Minecraft 1.16.2-1.16.5

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
1. Go to C:/Users/YOURUSERNAME/AppData/.minecraft/resourcepacks and extract Resource_Pack_template.zip.
2. Rename the folder to whatever you want your resource pack to be named.
3. Go into pack.mcmeta and change the discription to whatever you want your pack's description to be.
4. Go into the Assets folder and then into the Minecraft folder.
5. Choose what kind of asset you wish to change, and then open the file within those folders with a program that is compatible with that file type.
6. Load into minecraft and go into Options and then Resource packs, find your resource pack on the list, click on the arrow on it's icon, and click Done, your resource pack should be loaded now.

HOW TO ADD AN ICON
1. Select an image to be your resource pack's icon, it can be any resolution, as long as it is square. It is recommended you use 128x128 though, because that renders the best.
2. Save it into your resource pack's folder (the one with the the pack.mcmeta in it) and name it pack.png (make sure it's a png, if it's not, it won't work).

NOTES
I could not figure out how to include the sound files in this template, so sadly, they aren't here.
If I can find out how to do it, I will add them.
